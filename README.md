Password Generator by John O'Dell

In this project, we use a HTTP local host to input the length, title name, and type of password we want. It is then saved to a local CSV file that can be read at later for use of the password. 
The password can either contain letters and numbers or include symbols as well.
The length is determined by the user on the HTTP page, along with the name. 

There is a choice between the symbols as some websites have different allowences, as well with the length ranging between 12-20 characters form what I have found.

Read the Jupyter Examples for further details and explination on how the sketch is working and to read passwords after they have been generated.
